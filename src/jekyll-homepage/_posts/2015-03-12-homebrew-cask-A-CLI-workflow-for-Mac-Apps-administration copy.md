`Homebrew Cask` provides a friendly homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration of Mac applications distributed as binaries. It's implemented as a homebrew external command called `cask`.

An example installing `Virtualbox`, notice that, if the application was installed earlier, then `cask` will updated it.

```bash
$ brew update
