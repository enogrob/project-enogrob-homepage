`Kitematic` provides the easiest way to use Docker on your Mac.

It was announced recently the acquisition of Canadian startup [Kitematic](http://kitematic.com) and its eponymous, popular open source software tool. The [Docker](https://www.docker.com) experience is enhanced through Kitematic and its graphical user interface (GUI)-driven workflow that automatically installs Docker on a userâ€™s Mac to build, ship and run Docker containers in just minutes. Kitematic integrates with [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine) to provision a VM and install Docker Engine locally on your Mac.

Once installed, the Kitematic GUI launches and from the home screen you will be presented with curated images that you can run instantly.  You can search for any public images on Docker Hub from Kitematic just by typing in the search bar.  Easily create, run and manage your containers from the GUI and seamlessly switch back and forth between the Docker CLI and the GUI.
